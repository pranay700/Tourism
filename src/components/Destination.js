        text="The Taj Mahal 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628â€“1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.White sheets of still water under a half moonlight A land lain undisturbed for much of history, Visited in the past of an eerie knowingness, A discipline demanding sacrifice of all, A beneficent place where the seeker may Iive off the bounty of earth, Find perpetual warmth on southern shores, perpetual cold in the north."
